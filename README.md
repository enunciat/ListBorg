# List Borg - Chrome Extension
### Welcome 

List Borg is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly generate AI lists of similar items. Simply select some text, right-click, select the ListBorg context menu action, and the extension will use OpenAI's GPT-3 technology to generate a list of similar items for you. 

### Installation

Since it's not yet available on the Chrome webstore, to use List Borg, you will need to install the extension manually.

1. Clone or download the [List Borg repository from Github](https://github.com/enunciat/ListBorg) (click the Code dropdown above and select Download ZIP).
2. Open Google Chrome and go to your installed extensions: [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. Make sure Developer mode is enabled in the top right corner of the page. 
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page.
5. Select the folder containing the List Borg extension you downloaded in step 1.
6. Click the extensions icon in the toolbar (the puzzle piece), and click the List Borg icon (or click Pin beside List Borg and then click the icon). The List Borg popup will ask you to enter your OpenAI GPT-3 API key. If you don't have one, here's how to get one:

Visit the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) website to sign up for the beta.
Once you're approved, navigate to the API dashboard to generate your API key. You'll get enough free credits for lots of hearty usage.  

7. Paste in the key and click the "Add key" button, and you're ready to start generating lists!

### Usage

Select any text, right-click and select the ListBorg context menu action, and it'll bring up a list modal on the screen. Reconfigure and Refresh at will!

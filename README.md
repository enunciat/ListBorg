# List Borg - Chrome Extension
### Welcome

List Borg is a Chrome extension that allows you to quickly generate lists. Simply select some text, right-click, click the List Borg context menu action, and the extension will use OpenAI's GPT-3 technology to generate a list of similar items for you.

### Installation

To use List Borg, you will need to first install the extension. Since it is not currently available on the Chrome Web Store, you will need to load it manually.

1. Clone or download the [List Borg repository from Github](https://github.com/enunciat/ListBorg)
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. If it's not already, enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner of the page.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button in the top left corner of the page.
5. Select the folder containing the List Borg extension you downloaded in step 1.
6. After installing the extension, you will need to enter your OpenAI GPT-3 key. If you don't have one, here's how to get one:

Visit the [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) website to sign up for the beta.
Once you're approved, navigate to the API dashboard to get your API key.

7. With your key in hand, click on the List Borg extension's main popup icon in your extensions, and enter your key. Once you've entered your key, you're ready to start generating lists!

### Usage

To generate a list using List Borg, simply select any text you want to generate a list of similar items for, right-click, and select the List Borg action. A popup will appear with a list of similar items. You can then copy some of all of the list items or modify the list criteria and refresh it.
